review/summary: Periwinkle Dartmouth Blazer
review/text: I own the Austin Reed dartmouth blazer in every color in which they make it-- it is a staple of my business wardrobe. Well made, quality fabric, nicely tailored, classic lines, appropriate for a professional woman. (something that can be hard to find at times) It should be noted, however, that the periwinkle and raspberry colors are lovely, but the fabric and buttons are slightly different than the "classic" colors(lighter) and the linings and interfacings are not as substantial as the brown, navy, camel, red and ivory. It's still a good value, particularly as these are colors appropriate to warmer seasons and climates, but I was a bit surprised.

review/summary: Good value in gym wear
review/text: As is the case with most adidas products I've owned, my 3-stripe fleece pants are made for style, fit, and durability. They are just the right weight of fabric for those cool winter mornings in Southern California (not so for 85degree summer days, when I'll stash them away for cooler days to come). My size is somewhere between a medium and a large. These adidas pants are amply cut, but maybe a tad too roomy for my particular build. A medium would probably be restrictive when I'm doing calesthenics or some weight exercises. This being said, I am nevertheless very happy with this product and with Amazon's superior service.

Other than this one suggestion they wash and wear well.

review/text: I ordered these slacks specifically because the description said they had a comfort-fit waistband. I am an ostomy patient and occasionally need that little extra inch the elastic expansion in the waistband gives you. Despite clearly stating that these pants had that comfort-fit waistband, the pants I received did not have it. In all other regards these pants are perfectly fine, They fit well, and are in every other respect exactly what I expected. However, the fact is that they are still not what I ordered and are not as described.

review/summary: Best Dockers for the Money
review/text: The Dockers "individual fit" system works well, in that one can get by without "odd" waist sizes like 33, 35, etc. by ordering even sizes and allowing the system to stretch a bit if it needs to. These pants are very durable, and still look presentable after washing and machine drying. An ironing every so often would probably be useful for "business casual". A good value.

review/text: While the quality of the product is great, like so many wash pants today, there is no room at the waist for making adjustments. The rear seam is extremely tight, and while it can be taken in with difficulty, there is no room for letting out even 1/2 inch. Purchase a size above your waist size, and unless you can do it yourself, be prepared to pay for making these a good fit. Of course, if you don't mind bunching at the waist, you'll be OK.

Despite the fact that the image for "Cafe" shows a stone or very light gray color, "Cafe" is actually dark brown. So the product isn't defective, but IS misleading: I didn't want brown pants, but that's what I got.

review/text: To often I have made the mistake of ordering from unreliable clothing sellers, but not here. These are real Dockers slacks with real quality. These run true to size and are excellent quality materials for a decent price. I like the pleated slacks myself because after hitting thirty plus most men have a little extra in the handle section. Pleats seem to disguise that nicely. I recommend these because Dockers are great slacks and wear well, and these are true Dockers.CA Luster

review/summary: Casual and very classy.
review/text: I absolutely love these (white) Dockers pants! They go very well with both polo shirts and long-sleeve dress shirts and are made of very comfortable cotton. For summer wear, you can get a casual yet very classy look if you pair them with a shirt from Van Heusen, DKNY, Pierre Cardin, Geoffrey Beene, Stafford or other such brand. The "individual-fit" waistband automatically expands by one inch for added comfort.
